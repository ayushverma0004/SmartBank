### Important Extras : 



The purpose of this way of learning JAVA is to learn it intuitively such that using java becomes my second nature. Therefore I expect from myself little patience while balancing between digging deeper and remaining on surface knowledge. Also the project shouldn't be much too complex to not make me drown in the complexities losing motivation to progress further. You have to explain me the concepts before applying/adding to the project.
