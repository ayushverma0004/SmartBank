# SmartBank — Java Learning Project

A hands-on Java project designed to teach Java concepts *by building them directly into a working application*.
Every topic in the Java syllabus is explained first and then implemented inside the SmartBank project to make learning natural, intuitive, and practical.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To make Java feel like second nature by learning it through creation, not memorization.
The project grows gradually—never too simple to be boring and never too complex to overwhelm.
Every concept is introduced, explained, and then applied live.
